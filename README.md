# NLP_HW1_Divar_Car_Data

This repository includes the code for the HomeWork 1 of the Natural Language Processing class, lectured by Dr. Ehsaneddin Asgari in Fall 2023.

The code here uses the data crawled from the https://divar.ir/ website in 'car' category. The scraper.py script crawls and fetches all the required data, with any city desired.

The notebook, is used to analyse and inform the reader on the contents of the posts in the 'car' category.
